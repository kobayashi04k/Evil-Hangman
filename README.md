# Evil-Hangman
Your average game of hangman, but the word is not selected until the end.

This is a Java game that looks like a normal game of hangman. However, whenever the user guesses a letter, the game will remove any word from its built-in dictionary that contains the guessed letter. When the dictionary contains only one word left, that word becomes the word the user has to guess.
